NGHXRG - Teledyne HxRG Noise Generator

Modification History:

18 September 2020 Joe Filippazzo

  Made code more Pythonic, faster with Numpy array calls rather than list comprehensions,
and moved much of the heavy lifting caluclations from mknoise() out to dedicated methods.
Also added noise_sources property to track contributions from each noise source.

13 August 2020   Kevin Volk

  Modify this version to return the simulated ramp and to not change to 
unsigned integers.

11 August 2020   Kevin Volk

  Change the random number generation calls to use the new numpy interface.

23 July 2020    Kevin Volk

  A couple of bug fixes to the dark current image option were made.  The code 
was changed so it will work properly with a sub-array simulation.  Previously 
the values in the lower left corner were used not the values at the target 
position.

22 June 2020    Kevin Volk

  Port to python version 3.  Added writing out bias_pattern.fits.

16 September 2019   Kevin Volk

  Add an option to use an image for the dark current rather than a constant 
value.

2 June 2017   Kevin Volk

  I have added in pedestal offsets; the self.pedestal_drift variable in the code, 
described as the "magnitude of the pedestal drift in electrons" does not appear 
to be used in the original code.  I added a Gaussian offset per channel per 
frame based on this parameter.  Finally, I added an optional noise seed so one 
can reproduce a calculation.

26 May 2017   Kevin Volk

  I have added a uniform dark current to the code (electrons/frame).  I also added 
in a gain factor.

16 May 2017   Kevin Volk

  Some changes were made for use with NIRISS...the pedestal file name has 
been changed and a couple of the defaults have been changed as well.

8-15 April 2015, B.J. Rauscher, NASA/GSFC
- Implement Pierre Ferruit's (ESA/ESTEC)recommendation to use
  numpy.fft.rfft and numpy.fft.irfft for faster execution. This saves
  about 30% in execution time.
- Clean up setting default values per several suggestions from
  Chaz Shapiro (NASA/JPL).
- Change from setting the shell variable H2RG_PCA0 to point to the PCA-zero
  file to having a shell variable point to the NG home directory. This is per
  a suggestion from Chaz Shapiro (NASA/JPL) that would allow seamlessly adding  
  more PCA-zero templates.
- Implement a request form Chaz Shapiro (NASA/JPL) for status
  reporting. This was done by adding the "verbose" arguement.
- Implement a request from Pierre Ferruit (ESA/ESTEC) to generate
  3-dimensional data cubes.
- Implement a request from Pierre Ferruit to treat ACN as different 1/f
  noise in even/odd columns. Previously ACN was treated purely as a feature
  in Fourier space.
- Version 2(Beta)

16 April 2015, B.J. Rauscher
- Fixed a bug in the pinkening filter definitions. Abs() was used where
  sqrt() was intended. The bug caused power spectra to have the wrong shape at
  low frequency.
- Version 2.1(Beta)

17 April 2015, B.J. Rauscher
- Implement a request from Chaz Shapiro for HXRGNoise() to exit gracefully if
  the pca0_file is not found.
- Version 2.2 (Beta)

8 July 2015, B.J. Rauscher
- Address PASP referee comments
    * Fast scan direction is now reversible. To reverse the slow scan
      direction use the numpy flipud() function.
    * Modifications to support subarrays. Specifically,
        > Setting reference_pixel_border_width=0 (integer zero);
            + (1) eliminates the reference pixel border and
            + (2) turns off adding in a bias pattern
                  when simulating data cubes. (Turned on in v2.5)
- Version 2.4

12 Oct 2015, J.M. Leisenring, UA/Steward
- Make compatible with Python 2.x
    * from __future__ import division
- Included options for subarray modes (FULL, WINDOW, and STRIPE)
    * Keywords x0 and y0 define a subarray position (lower left corner)
    * Selects correct pca0 region for subarray underlay
    * Adds reference pixels if they exist within subarray window
- Tie negative values to 0 and anything >=2^16 to 2^16-1
- Version 2.5

20 Oct 2015, J.M. Leisenring, UA/Steward
- Padded nstep to the next power of 2 in order to improve FFT runtime
    * nstep2 = int(2**np.ceil(np.log2(nstep)))
    * Speeds up FFT calculations by ~5x
- Don't generate noise elements if their magnitudes are equal to 0.
- mknoise() now returns copy of final HDU result for easy retrieval
- Version 2.6
